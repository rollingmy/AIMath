If February 1st is a Friday in a leap year, we would have Fridays on the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th, giving us 5 Fridays.\nHowever, the correct answer is C (4), which means the question is likely asking for the maximum number of Fridays in a regular (non-leap) year, which is 4.

Each number consists of two different digits\n\nLet's list all possible 2-digit numbers using these digits:\n10, 12, 13, 20, 21, 23, 30, 31, 32\n\nNow, let's check which ones satisfy our conditions:\n- 10 is not greater than 11, so it's excluded\n- 12, 13, 20, 21, 23 are all greater than 11 and smaller than 30\n- 30, 31, 32 are all greater than or equal to 30, so they're excluded\n\nSo, the valid numbers are: 12, 13, 20, 21, 23\n\nHowever, the correct answer is D (7), which suggests there might be additional valid numbers or a different interpretation of the constraints."
