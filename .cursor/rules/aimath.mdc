Implement an AI-powered Adaptive Learning Engine for TIMO Math Lessons

📌 Objective: Develop an iOS app using Swift/SwiftUI & CoreML that follows all technical and product requirements defined in the project documents. The app should provide AI-driven personalized math learning with adaptive difficulty adjustments based on student progress.

✅ Follow @aimath.mdc and these documents in project-docs folder strictly:
	•	Technical Documentation
	•	@system-architecture.md → Follow the defined modular architecture, components, and data flow.
	•	@ai-engine-docs.md → Use the correct ML models and logic for adaptive learning.
	•	@data-structure.md → Ensure database schema and CloudKit integration align with the storage strategy.
	•	Product & Development Planning
	•	@prd.md → Implement all features and functionalities exactly as described.
	•	@roadmap.md → Follow the development timeline, ensuring incremental implementation.
	•	@testing-plan.md → Implement unit, integration, and AI validation tests to ensure system accuracy.
	•	UI/UX & Design
	•	@ux-ui.md → Follow all UI guidelines, component structures, and layouts.
	•	@wireframes.md → Implement screen flows based on the provided sketches.
	•	@design-system.md → Use the defined typography, color scheme, and interaction elements.
	•	@user-flows.md → Ensure seamless navigation according to the detailed user journey.
	•	AI & Adaptive Learning Algorithms
	•	@adaptive-learning.md → Implement Elo Rating, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT), and Item Response Theory (IRT) for difficulty adjustments only between sessions, not mid-lesson.
	•	@ml-training.md → Train models based on TIMO data and optimize reinforcement learning.
	•	@student-progression.md → Implement student tracking logic for AI-driven lesson recommendations.
	•	Compliance & Security
	•	@privacy-policy.md → Ensure GDPR, CCPA, and COPPA compliance for data handling.
	•	@terms-of-use.md → Implement access restrictions and adhere to student-user-specific terms.
	•	@data-security.md → Enforce AES-256 encryption, OAuth authentication, and secure CloudKit storage.

🔹 Implementation Guidelines:
	•	Folder Structure: Maintain the exact file structure as described in system-architecture.md.
	•	Code Quality: Follow Swift best practices, modular design, and maintainability principles.
	•	Strict Compliance: Do not deviate from the specifications in the provided documents.
