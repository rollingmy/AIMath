## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Functional Testing**
üìå **Objective:** Ensure all core features function correctly.

| **Test Case** | **Description** | **Expected Outcome** |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| User Registration | Create a new user profile | User successfully registered |
| Login & Authentication | Verify login with valid credentials | User successfully logged in |
| AI Lesson Selection | AI recommends a lesson based on progress | Correct lesson displayed |
| Answer Submission | User submits multiple-choice or open-ended response | Answer saved and evaluated |
| Progress Tracking | Ensure lesson completion updates progress stats | Progress reflected accurately |

‚úÖ **Tools Used:** Postman (API testing), XCTest (Swift functional testing)

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ AI Model Validation**
üìå **Objective:** Ensure AI-driven lesson selection and adaptive difficulty function correctly.

| **Test Case** | **Description** | **Expected Outcome** |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Difficulty Adjustment | AI increases difficulty for high-performing students | Next session has harder questions |
| Reinforcement Learning | AI suggests related questions for incorrect answers | Personalized learning path generated |
| Knowledge Retention | AI tracks long-term mastery with BKT | Accurate skill estimation |
| Response Time Analysis | AI evaluates speed and confidence | AI insights match user trends |

‚úÖ **Tools Used:** Python (AI model validation), CoreML evaluation scripts

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ UI/UX Testing**
üìå **Objective:** Validate usability, accessibility, and responsiveness.

| **Test Case** | **Description** | **Expected Outcome** |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Navigation & Flow | Users can seamlessly navigate lessons | No UI/UX roadblocks |
| Touch Interactions | Buttons and inputs work as expected | Smooth user experience |
| Accessibility Compliance | Text-to-speech and color contrast checks | Meets WCAG 2.1 standards |
| Mobile Responsiveness | Works across various iPad and iPhone models | Fully responsive layout |

‚úÖ **Tools Used:** Figma (UI testing), iOS Simulator, VoiceOver (Accessibility checks)

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Testing**
üìå **Objective:** Ensure the app runs efficiently without lag.

| **Test Case** | **Description** | **Expected Outcome** |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| AI Response Time | AI generates lesson recommendations in real-time | < 2 seconds processing time |
| Offline Mode | Lessons load without an internet connection | No functionality loss offline |
| Cloud Sync | Data syncs across devices correctly | Accurate progress reflected on all devices |
| Battery Usage | App does not drain excessive battery | Efficient energy consumption |

‚úÖ **Tools Used:** Xcode Instruments, Firebase Performance Monitoring

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Compliance Testing**
üìå **Objective:** Ensure data security and compliance with child protection laws.

| **Test Case** | **Description** | **Expected Outcome** |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Data Encryption | User data is securely stored and transmitted | Meets GDPR & COPPA encryption standards |
| Authentication Security | Invalid login attempts are limited | Prevents brute-force attacks |
| Data Privacy Compliance | Ensures minimal data collection for children | Meets GDPR/COPPA guidelines |
| API Security | Prevents unauthorized access | Secured API endpoints |

‚úÖ **Tools Used:** OWASP ZAP (security scanning), CloudKit security tests

---

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Bug Tracking & Reporting**
üìå **Process for tracking and resolving issues:**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Log Issues:** Report bugs using Jira/Trello with screenshots and steps to reproduce.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Assign Priority:** Critical (blocks functionality), High, Medium, Low.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Fix & Retest:** Developers resolve issues, QA retests before deployment.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Regression Testing:** Ensure fixes do not introduce new issues.  

‚úÖ **Bug Tracking Tool:** Jira, TestFlight (Beta Testing Feedback)

---

## **8Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps & Deployment Criteria**
‚úÖ **Pass all functional, AI, and UI tests before launch.**  
‚úÖ **Fix all critical and high-priority bugs before release.**  
‚úÖ **Run final security and performance audits.**  

üìå **Next Steps:** Beta testing, final AI validation, and deployment approval.
