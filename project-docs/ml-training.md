## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Reinforcement Learning & Feedback Mechanism**
üìå **Goal:** Improve AI recommendations through continuous learning.

### **4.1 AI Feedback Loop**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Student completes a lesson** ‚Üí AI records accuracy & response time.
2Ô∏è‚É£ **AI evaluates weak areas** ‚Üí Identifies common mistakes.
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Difficulty is adjusted for the next session** (not mid-session).
4Ô∏è‚É£ **New personalized lesson generated** based on updated student model.

‚úÖ **Example Feedback Logic:**
- **High accuracy & fast response ‚Üí Increase difficulty next session.**
- **Struggles with specific concepts ‚Üí Reinforce similar questions.**
- **Long response time but correct ‚Üí AI adjusts pacing rather than difficulty.**

### **4.2 Adaptive Learning Improvements**
- **AI tracks student growth** over weeks/months.
- **Reinforcement model rewards correct conceptual mastery**.
- **AI continuously refines difficulty predictions** based on **real-world usage**.
