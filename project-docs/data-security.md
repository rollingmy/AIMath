# **Data Security Policy for Adaptive Learning Engine (TIMO Math Lessons)**

## **1️⃣ Overview**
📌 **Purpose:** This document outlines the encryption, authentication, and data retention policies for protecting user data in compliance with **GDPR, CCPA, and COPPA regulations**.

✅ **Key Security Areas:**
- Data Encryption & Secure Storage
- Authentication & Access Control
- Data Retention & Deletion Policy
- Compliance & Security Best Practices

---

## **2️⃣ Data Encryption & Secure Storage**
📌 **Goal:** Ensure all user data remains **confidential, secure, and protected** from unauthorized access.

✅ **Encryption Standards:**
| **Data Type** | **Encryption Method** |
|-------------|------------------|
| User Information | AES-256 Encryption |
| Learning Progress Data | End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) |
| Authentication Tokens | Secure Hashing (SHA-256) |
| API Communication | TLS 1.3 Encryption |

✅ **Cloud Storage Security:**
- **Data is stored in Apple’s CloudKit**, which follows **industry-leading security protocols**.
- **All personal and progress data is encrypted at rest and in transit.**
- **Sensitive information is anonymized** before processing by AI models.

✅ **Offline Mode Security:**
- **Local data is sandboxed** within the app to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Automatic sync** to CloudKit when online.

## **3️⃣ Authentication & Access Control**
📌 **Goal:** Prevent unauthorized access to student accounts.

✅ **Authentication Methods:**
- **OAuth 2.0** authentication for secure login.
- **Apple Sign-In support** for seamless authentication.
- **Session Tokens** with expiration time to prevent session hijacking.

✅ **Access Control Measures:**
- **Role-based access** (Student, Parent, Admin).
- **Rate limiting & anomaly detection** to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for admin accounts.

✅ **Parental Controls:**
- Parents can **request data access or deletion** for their child.
- **Child accounts cannot interact with external users** to prevent data misuse.

## **4️⃣ Data Retention & Deletion Policy**
📌 **Goal:** Store only necessary data and provide users control over their data.

✅ **Data Retention Periods:**
| **Data Type** | **Retention Period** |
|-------------|----------------|
| Student Learning Progress | 12 months (auto-deletion if inactive) |
| User Account Information | Stored until deletion request |
| Error Logs | 30 days (for debugging) |

✅ **Data Deletion Requests:**
- **Users can request data deletion** via **support@timomathapp.com**.
- **Immediate account deletion** upon verified request.
- **AI models do NOT store personal student data** for training.

✅ **Automated Data Cleanup:**
- Inactive accounts are **deleted after 12 months**.
- Personally identifiable information (PII) is **removed from logs after 30 days**.

## **5️⃣ Compliance & Security Best Practices**
📌 **Regulatory Compliance:**
✅ **GDPR Compliance** → Users have the right to access, modify, and delete their data.  
✅ **CCPA Compliance** → No sale of personal data, and users can opt out of data collection.  
✅ **COPPA Compliance** → Strict parental consent required for child accounts.  

📌 **Security Best Practices:**
✅ **Regular Security Audits** → Annual penetration testing & vulnerability scans.  
✅ **Incident Response Plan** → Immediate action on security threats.  
✅ **Least Privilege Principle** → Limited data access based on necessity.
