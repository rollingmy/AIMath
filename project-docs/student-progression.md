# **Student Progression & AI Recommendations**

## **1️⃣ Overview**
📌 **Purpose:** Define the logic for tracking student progress and how AI adjusts future lessons based on performance trends.

✅ **Key Components:**
- Progress Tracking Mechanism
- AI Evaluation & Learning Paths
- Personalized Lesson Recommendations
- Long-Term Student Growth Analysis

---

## **2️⃣ Progress Tracking Mechanism**
📌 **Goal:** Continuously monitor student performance and adjust learning paths accordingly.

✅ **Metrics Tracked:**
| **Metric** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Accuracy Rate** | Percentage of correct answers per subject. |
| **Response Time** | Speed at which answers are submitted. |
| **Concept Mastery** | AI prediction of understanding using BKT. |
| **Weak Areas** | Topics where the student struggles consistently. |
| **Lesson Completion** | Number of lessons completed vs. skipped. |

✅ **Data Storage:**
- **Local Device** (CoreML) → Short-term session data.
- **Cloud Sync (CloudKit)** → Long-term progress tracking.

---

## **3️⃣ AI Evaluation & Learning Paths**
📌 **Goal:** Analyze student responses to determine the **next best lesson**.

✅ **Step-by-Step AI Process:**
1️⃣ **Lesson Completed** → AI evaluates answers, accuracy, and response time.
2️⃣ **Elo Rating Update** → Adjusts difficulty for the **next session**.
3️⃣ **BKT Mastery Check** → Identifies weak concepts requiring reinforcement.
4️⃣ **IRT Difficulty Scaling** → Ensures the student receives appropriately challenging questions.
5️⃣ **AI Generates Personalized Lesson Plan** → Tailored to student strengths & weaknesses.

✅ **Example AI Decision Logic:**
- **High Accuracy & Fast Response** → Increase difficulty in future lessons.
- **Low Accuracy & Slow Response** → Introduce easier questions for reinforcement.
- **Struggles in a Specific Concept** → AI selects related problems for next session.
- **Consistent Success in a Topic** → Move to more advanced concepts.

---

## **4️⃣ Personalized Lesson Recommendations**
📌 **Goal:** Ensure AI suggests the most effective **next lesson**.

✅ **Recommendation Logic:**
- AI selects **questions from the same subject** if improvement is needed.
- AI **diversifies topics** if mastery is detected.
- Lessons are **balanced between review and new learning**.

✅ **Lesson Selection Flow:**
1️⃣ **Check student’s weak areas** → Prioritize reinforcement.
2️⃣ **Analyze recent performance trends** → Ensure gradual progression.
3️⃣ **Select next questions based on AI model recommendations.**

✅ **Example Scenarios:**
| **Student Performance** | **AI Response** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| 90% accuracy in Arithmetic | Suggest more challenging Arithmetic problems. |
| 50% accuracy in Geometry | Reinforce easier Geometry concepts. |
| Slow response time but correct | Keep difficulty the same, but allow more time. |
| Struggles with word problems | Offer step-by-step guided problems. |

---

## **5️⃣ Long-Term Student Growth Analysis**
📌 **Goal:** Track **improvement trends** and adjust AI recommendations accordingly.

✅ **Trend Analysis Metrics:**
| **Metric** | **Purpose** |
|------------|------------|
| **Skill Progression** | Tracks concept mastery over time. |
| **Engagement Levels** | Monitors frequency and consistency of learning. |
| **Confidence Growth** | Measures response speed improvements. |
| **Personalized AI Reports** | Generates insights for students & parents. |

✅ **Monthly AI Reports Include:**
- Subjects mastered vs. needing improvement.
- Performance trend graphs.
- Suggested study focus for the next month.

---

## **6️⃣ Next Steps & Enhancements**
✅ **Improve AI trend detection** for better progress insights.
✅ **Enhance student engagement tracking** for personalized reminders.
✅ **Expand AI-generated reports** for deeper learning insights.

📌 **Next Steps:** Refine AI recommendation logic & optimize difficulty scaling. 🚀
